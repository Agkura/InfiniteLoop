# InfiniteLoop
[InfiniteLoop][infinite] is a single-page web application built to extract the core functionality of sites like [StackOverflow][stack], from which it is inspired, in a minimalistic manner.

InfiniteLoop was meant to be constructed within a loose two-week time-frame with the intent on being spartan and intuitive.
